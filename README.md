# Challenge-3-Server-and-Database-Commands
Challenge 3
Java Back-End focused on ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Information Processing. The challenge centers on system integration and the secure management of external data.

# Project Purpose and Relevance
The main objective is to automate the access and structuring of complex academic data obtained via the SerpApi Google Scholar API. 
This Scraping-as-a-Service solution is utilized to outsource the complexities of direct web scraping.

Strategic Value: By programmatically obtaining clean information, the project facilitates bibliometric analysis and data-driven decision-making, which would be impossible with manual collection.

System Design: The project aims to adhere to principles of normalization and robust design.

# Key Features
The system demonstrates professional integration and a resilient design:

1. Secure and Authenticated API Consumption
Communication with the API server follows strict security protocols:

Main Endpoint: The connection is directed to the base endpoint https://serpapi.com/search, specifying the engine with the parameter engine=google_scholar.

Authentication: Access is validated using a unique API Key, sent as a Query Parameter with every request.

2. Custom Search Querying
The system implements key parameters to refine data extraction:

Essential Filters: Mandatory parameters used include engine, api_key, and q (search term).

Temporal Control: Advanced filters like as_ylo (starting year) and as_yhi (ending year) are applied to narrow the search by date range.

3. JSON Processing and POO Mapping
The Java back-end is designed to manage the API's response format:

Format: The server returns information in JSON format.

Structure: The code processes the JSON structure, which includes metadata (search_metadata) and the specific academic results (organic_results).

Transformation: The key process is converting this JSON into a Java Object Model (POO/OOP), allowing direct access to fields like the title and the citation count (total under cited_by).
